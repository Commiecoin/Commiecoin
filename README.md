## What is Commiecoin?
Commiecoin is a cryptocurrency that uses peer-to-peer technology to send money anywhere at anytime without a central authority.
Commiecoin uses the Lyra2REv2 algorithm to secure transactions. Because it uses this algorithm for its proof-of-work, it's ASIC-resistant (or annoying for ASICs at least).
